The Ahaggar Framework

Ahaggar is a collection of GCC plugins and various scripts intended
to perform quick code analysis.

Requirements:
* Using GCC internals must be able at least to understand C.
* Reduce external dependencies to the min, better without.
* Large projects analysis should scale well.
* Easy to package and to integrate into build systems.
* Keep it simple.
